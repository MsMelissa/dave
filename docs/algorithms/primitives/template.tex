\section{[Primitive Name]}

introduces the primitive - short narative describing the operation

\subsection{Input data}

describes the expectations of the input data (shape/type/number/etc)

possible subsubsections for each generic category of expectation
- one of these SHOULD be a JSON Schema or other type of machine readable description of the data

\subsection{Output Data}

describes the expectations of the output data (shape/type/number/etc)

possible subsubsections for each generic category of expectation
- one of these SHOULD be a JSON Schema or other type of machine readable description of the data

\subsection{Operation}

summary of operation in numbered list of steps

\subsubsection{Formal Specification}

z spec for the primitive

\subsubsection{Pseudocode}

should follow the format used in the existing Pseudocode sections of each algorithm definition

\section{Recommended Primitives}

intro text for the purpose of this section

\subsection{Complementary}

primitives which should be used hand-in-hand with the primitive defined in this tex document - doesn't consider ordering

\subsection{Input Data Producers}

primitives which produce output data which can serve as input data to the primitive defined in this tex document

subset of the primitives referenced within the Complementary section

\subsection{Output Data Consumers}

primitives which consume the output data of the primitive defined in this tex document

subset of the primitives referenced within the Complementary section

\subsection{Alternatives}

primitives which may be used instead of the primitive defined in this tex document

subset of the primitives referenced within the Complementary section

\subsection{Related}

primitives which are in some other way related to the primitive defined in this tex document

MAY be a subset of the primitives referenced wtihin the Complementary section

\subsubsection{By Operation}

references to other Primitives which have a similar but not identical operation

\subsubsection{By Input Data}

references to other Primitives which expect similar or idential input data

\subsubsection{By Output Data}

references to other Primitives which produce similar output data
