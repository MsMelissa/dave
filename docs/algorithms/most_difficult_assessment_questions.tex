\section{Which Assessment Questions are the Most Difficult}
As learners engage in activities supported by a learning ecosystem, they will
experience learning content as well as assessment content. Assessments
are designed to measure the effectiveness of learning content and help
assess knowledge gained. It is possible that certain assessment questions
do not accurately represent the concepts contained within learning
content and this may be indicated by a majority of learners getting
the question wrong. It is also possible that the question accurately
represents the learning content but is very difficult. The following
algorithm will identify these types of questions but will not be able to deduce
why learners answer them incorrectly.

\subsection{Ideal Statements}
In order to accurately determine which assessment questions are the
most dificult, there are a few requirements of the data produced by a
LRP. They are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item statements describing a learner answering a question must report
  if the learner got the question correct or incorrect via $\$.result.success$
\item if it is possible to get partial credit on a question, the amount
  of credit should be reported within the statement
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the credit earned by the learner should be reported within \\ $\$.result.score.raw$
  \item the minimum and maximum possible credit amount should be
    reported within $\$.result.score.min$ and $\$.result.score.max$
    respectively
  \end{itemize}
\item If it is possible to get partial credit on a question, it must
  still be reported if the learner reached the threshold of success
  via $\$.result.success$
\item Statements describing a learner answering a question should
  contain activities of the type $cmi.interaction$
\item activities must be uniquely and consistently identified across
  all statements
\item Statements describing a learner answering a question
  should\footnote{\label{verbIRI} it is possible to use another verb iri but if another is
    used, that will need to be accounted for in data retrieval} use
  the verb $http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/answered$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Input Data Retrieval}
How to query an LRS via a GET request to the Statements Resource via
curl. The following section contains the appropriate parameters with
example values as well as the curl command necessary for making the request.\footnote{\label{refMoreLink} See footnote 1.}\footnote{\label{refnoZ} See footnote 2.}\footnote{\label{refallTime} See footnote 3.}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
  Verb = "verb=http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/answered"

  Since = "since=2018-07-20T12:08:47Z"

  Until = "until=2018-07-21T12:08:47Z"

  Base = "https://example.endpoint/statements?"

  endpoint = Base + Verb + "&" + Since + "&" + Until

  Auth = Hash generated from basic auth

  S = curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Auth"
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -H "X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3"
  Endpoint
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Statement Parameters to Utilize}

The statement parameter locations here are written in
\href{http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/}{JSONPath}. This notation
is also compatable with the xAPI Z notation due to the defined
hierarchy of components. Within the Z specifications, a variable name
will be used instead of the $\$$
\begin{itemize}
\item $\$.result.success$
\item $\$.object.id$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2018 Pilot TLA Statement Problems}
The initial pilot test data supports this algorithm.
Given that the offical 2018 pilot test is scheduled to take place on July
27th, 2018, this section may require updates pending future data review.

\subsection{Summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Query an LRS via a \href{https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#213-get-statements}{GET} request to the statements endpoint using the parameters verb, since and until
\item Filter the results to the set of statements where:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\$.result.success$ is false
  \end{itemize}
\item process the filtered data
  \begin{itemize}
  \item group by $\$.object.id$
  \item determine the count of each group
  \item create a collection of pairs = [$\$.object.id$, \#]
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

  \caption{Most Difficult Assessment Questions}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Z schemas are used within this pseudocode
\item The return value display is an array of length display-n, where
  each element of display is an array of [$statement.object.id$, \#]
  where $\#$ representing the number of times $statement.object.id$
  appeared within $S_{incorrect}'$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{JSON Schema}

\subsection{Visualization Description}
The \textbf{Most Difficult Assessment Questions} visualization will be
a bar chart where the domain consists of $statement.object.id$ and the
range is a number greater than or equal to 1. Every subarray within
the array display will be a grouping within the bar chart. The
pseudocode specifies an input paramter display-n which controls the
length of the array display and therefor the number of groups contained within
the visualization.


\subsection{Visualization prototype}

\pgfplotstabletypeset[string type]

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    title = Most Difficult Assessment Questions,
    ylabel = Number of Incorrects,
    symbolic x coords={question1-id,question2-id,question3-id,question4-id},
    xtick=data]
    \addplot[ybar,fill=blue] coordinates{
      (question1-id,122)

      (question4-id,127)
    };
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Prototype Improvement Suggestions}
Additional features may be implemented on top of this base
specification but they would require adding aditional values to each
subarray returned by the algorithm. These additional values can be
retrieved via (1) performing metadata lookup within or independently
of the algorithm (2) by utilizing additional xAPI statement paramters
and/or (3) by performing additional computations. The following
examples assume the metadata is contained within each statement
available to the algorithm.

\begin{itemize}
\item Use the name of the activity for the x-axis label instead of
  its id.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\$.object.definition.name$
  \item grouping of statements should still happen by
    $\$.object.id$ to ensure an accurate count
  \end{itemize}
\item a tooltip containing contextual information about the question
  such as:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The question text
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\$.object.definition.description$
    \end{itemize}
  \item Interaction Type
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\$.object.definition$ which contains interaction properties
    \end{itemize}
  \item Answer choices
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\$.object.definition$ which contains interaction properties
    \end{itemize}
  \item Correct answer
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\$.object.definition$ which contains interaction properties
    \end{itemize}
  \item Most popular incorrect answer
    \begin{itemize}
    \item This would require an extra step of processing and all
      statements would need to utilize interaction properties within
      $\$.object.definition$
    \end{itemize}
  \item average partial credit earned (if applicable)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\$.result.score.scaled$
    \item The one potential issue with using scaled score is the
      calculation of scaled is not stricly defined by the xAPI
      specification but is instead up to the authors of the LRP. This
      results in the inability to reliably compare scaled scores across LRPs.
    \item if $\$.result.score.raw$ , $\$.result.score.min$ and
      $\$.result.score.max$ are reported for all questions, it becomes
      possible to reliably compare scores across questions and LRPs.
    \end{itemize}
  \item average number of re-attempts
    \begin{itemize}
    \item this would require additional steps of processing so that
      $\$.actor$ is considered as well
    \item due to the problem of actor unification, ie the same
      person being identified differently across statements, this
      metric may not be accurate.
    \end{itemize}
  \item average time spent on the question
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\$.result.duration$
    \item this would require additional steps of processing to
      extract the duration and average it.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item a tooltip containing contextual information about the course
  and/or assessment the question was within
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the instructor for the course
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\$.context.instructor$
    \end{itemize}
  \item competency associated with the question and/or course
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\$.context.contextActivities$
    \end{itemize}
  \item metadata about the learning content associated with the
    question such as average time spent engaging with associated
    content before attempting the question.
  \item this would require additional steps of processing to
    retrieve metadata about the content and its usage.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\$.context.contextActivities$
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
