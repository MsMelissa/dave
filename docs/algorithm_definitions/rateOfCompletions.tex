\section{Rate of Completions}
As learners engage in activities supported by a learning ecosystem, they will build
up a history of learning experiences. When the digital resources of that learning ecosystem
adhere to a framework dedicated to supporting and understanding the
learner, such as the Total Learning Architecture (TLA), it becomes
possible to retell their learning story through data and data visualization. One important aspect of
that story is the rate of completion of the various digital resources within the learning ecosystem.

\subsection{Initialization}
$init(state)$ sets up an empty $KV$ within $state$ for the Algorithm to update at each $step$
$$init(state) = state_{0}$$
where
$$state_{0} = associate(state, <state, completions>, <>) \iff atKey(state, <state, completions>) = nil$$
otherwise
$$state_{0} = state$$
such that if
$$state = <a \mapsto b>$$
then
$$state_{0} = <a \mapsto b, state \mapsto completions \mapsto <>>$$

\subsection{Relevant?}
What primitives are used to determine if a Statement is relevant
\subsection{Accept?}
What primitives are used to determine if a Statement is accepted
\subsection{Step}
What primitives are used to process a Statement to update $state$
\subsection{Return}
What $opts$ are used if any + what does the $state$ look like?
