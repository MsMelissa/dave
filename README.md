# DAVE
## The Data Analytics Visualization Efficiency Framework for xAPI and the Total Learning Architecture

*Quickstart: Click on "Projects" above to see the current status of issues. Feel free to start working on the issues of your choice.*

**What is DAVE?**

The DAVE Framework will provide an open source means of creating domain-based xAPI learning data dashboards. It is extendable to new learning problems, instructional strategies, technological realities, and metrics objectives and will provide a framework for analysis and visualization which aligns with xAPI, xAPI Profiles, and the Total Learning Architecture (TLA).

**The framework will feature**

* a suite of prototype analytics algorithms and data visualization templates
* open source dashboard prototypes for TLA data analytics and visualization
* open source code — reusable by developers and learning engineers — that is modular and aligned to the capabilities of xAPI & xAPI Profiles and the flexible and extensible needs of the Total Learning Architecture.

Project DAVE is funded by the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative at the U.S. Department of Defense.
