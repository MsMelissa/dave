The Data Analytics Visualization Efficiency Framework for xAPI and the Total Learning Architecture

What is DAVE?
If the objective is to analyze, interpret, and visualize micro-level behavior-driven learning, we need a framework for analysis and visualization which aligns with xAPI, xAPI Profiles, and the Total Learning Architecture (TLA).

Enter Project DAVE — a framework featuring a suite of prototype analytics algorithms and data visualization templates, open source dashboard prototypes for TLA data analytics and visualization, open source code — reusable by developers and learning engineers — that is modular and aligned to the capabilities of xAPI & xAPI Profiles and the needs of the TLA.

Project DAVE is funded by the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative at the U.S. Department of Defense.
